1) Update Dilla to the new application :

2) Build Model based on Abstrct Factory Pattern
   - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern
    
3) Work on Scalability
    The current algorithm to caculate the amoun of concurrent calls is not accurate,
    we should redesign this in a different maneer.
    Maybe collecting the amount of concurrent calls via a daemon on the Asterisk Server

4) FreeSwitch Support
